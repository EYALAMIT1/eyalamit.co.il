# Performance Baseline Report - Eyal Amit Website
**Date:** January 12, 2026
**Tester:** Team 2 (QA & Monitor)
**Environment:** Production Baseline Establishment

## Executive Summary

Due to technical limitations in running automated Lighthouse scans on the production environment, this report establishes a manual performance baseline based on code analysis and configuration review. A full Lighthouse Mobile scan should be conducted once access issues are resolved.

## Current Configuration Analysis

### Server Configuration
- **Web Server:** Nginx
- **Application:** WordPress with PHP-FPM
- **Database:** MariaDB 10.6
- **Caching:** Basic nginx configuration with static asset caching

### Key Performance Settings
- `client_max_body_size: 256M` - Allows large uploads
- `sendfile on` - Optimized file serving
- `tcp_nopush on` - Reduces network packets
- `keepalive_timeout: 65s` - Connection reuse enabled

### Static Asset Optimization
- CSS/JS/PNG/JPG/JPEG/GIF/ICO/SVG files configured with:
  - `expires max` - Maximum caching
  - `log_not_found off` - Reduced logging overhead

## Asset Size Analysis

### CSS Files (Sample)
- Admin menu CSS: 15KB
- Common CSS: 52KB
- Customize controls: 57-68KB
- Forms CSS: 22KB

### JavaScript Files
- Multiple JS files present in WordPress core and plugins
- No minification analysis available without runtime scan

## Performance Observations

### Positive Indicators
1. **Caching Configuration:** Static assets properly configured for long-term caching
2. **Server Optimization:** Sendfile and TCP optimizations enabled
3. **Database:** Modern MariaDB version with health checks

### Areas Requiring Measurement
1. **Runtime Performance:** Cannot measure without successful Lighthouse scan
2. **Image Optimization:** Need to check if images are properly compressed
3. **JavaScript Execution:** Need to measure blocking scripts and execution time
4. **CSS Delivery:** Need to check for render-blocking CSS
5. **Server Response Time:** Need actual TTFB measurements

## Access Issues Encountered

1. **Production Site:** Chrome interstitial preventing automated scanning
2. **API Limits:** Google PageSpeed Insights quota exceeded
3. **Local Environment:** Docker setup timeout during image downloads

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Resolve production site access for automated testing
2. Establish proper testing environment with Chrome access
3. Set up monitoring for performance regressions

### Baseline Metrics to Establish
- Lighthouse Performance Score (target: >90)
- First Contentful Paint (target: <1.5s)
- Largest Contentful Paint (target: <2.5s)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (target: <0.1)
- Total Blocking Time (target: <200ms)

### Next Steps
1. Resolve technical access issues
2. Conduct full Lighthouse Mobile scan
3. Establish performance monitoring
4. Set up automated regression testing

## Status
**PENDING:** Full Lighthouse scan blocked by access restrictions. Manual baseline established based on configuration analysis.
