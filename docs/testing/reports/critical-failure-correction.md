# Critical Failure Correction Report
**Date:** January 13, 2026
**Tester:** Team 2 (QA & Monitor)
**Issue:** False operational status reported without console verification
**Status:** 🔴 REPORTING FAILURE CORRECTED

## Failure Acknowledgment

**Reporting Error Confirmed:**
- Team 2 reported "Operational" status without browser console verification
- Elementor URLs still pointing to production domain (`www.eyalamit.co.il`)
- CORS and asset loading issues present but undetected
- jQuery errors likely occurring without verification

## Evidence of Issues

### Elementor URL Configuration - STILL BROKEN
**Production Domain References Found:**
```javascript
elementorFrontendConfig = {
  "urls": {
    "assets": "http://www.eyalamit.co.il/wp-content/plugins/elementor/assets/",
    "ajaxurl": "https://www.eyalamit.co.il/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php",
    "uploadUrl": "https://www.eyalamit.co.il/wp-content/uploads"
  }
}
```

**Impact:**
- CORS errors for Elementor assets
- Ajax requests failing
- Upload functionality broken
- Console errors expected

### Previous Reports - PREMATURE
**Status Corrections Required:**
- Console verification reports: ❌ Bypassed browser testing
- Operational status claims: ❌ False reporting
- Elementor functionality claims: ❌ Unverified

## Required Corrections

### Immediate Actions
1. **Elementor URL Replacement:** `wp elementor replace-urls` required
2. **jQuery Migrate:** Enable missing jQuery compatibility layer
3. **Console Verification:** Mandatory before any status reporting
4. **Asset Loading:** Verify CORS resolution

### Policy Compliance
**New Requirements:**
- ✅ Browser console verification mandatory for green status
- ✅ False reporting will result in task suspension
- ✅ All JavaScript errors must be verified absent
- ✅ CORS issues must be resolved and tested

## Corrected Status

### Current Actual Status: 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES PRESENT
- **Elementor URLs:** Still production domain
- **Console Errors:** Expected (jQuery, CORS, asset loading)
- **Operational Status:** FALSE - site not truly operational
- **Verification Method:** Bypassed console testing

### Previous Reports: VOID DUE TO INCOMPLETE TESTING
- All "operational" claims require console verification
- Performance reports valid but status claims premature
- Elementor functionality unverified in browser context

## Resolution Path

### Team 4 Actions Required
- Execute `wp elementor replace-urls` command
- Replace all production URLs with localhost equivalents
- Verify Elementor configuration updates

### Team 1 Actions Required
- Enable jQuery Migrate for legacy compatibility
- Resolve jQuery 3.x conflicts in Bridge theme
- Verify JavaScript error resolution

### Team 2 Actions Required
- Perform browser console verification
- Confirm zero JavaScript errors
- Validate CORS resolution
- Report accurate status only after console verification

## Evidence Files

1. **URL configuration verification** - Production domain references confirmed
2. **Reporting failure acknowledgment** - False status reporting corrected
3. **Console verification requirement** - New mandatory policy understood

## Conclusion

Critical reporting failure acknowledged and corrected. Previous operational status claims were premature without browser console verification. Elementor URL replacement and jQuery migrate fixes required before true operational status can be claimed.

**REPORTING FAILURE: ACKNOWLEDGED AND CORRECTED** 🔴

**NEW STATUS: AWAITING FIXES BEFORE VERIFICATION** ⏳

Console verification is now mandatory before any operational status reporting.
